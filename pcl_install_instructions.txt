Installing PCL 1.8 with cython 0.25.2 and python-pcl v0.3.0rc1  for ROS kinetic 

1- pip install Cython==0.25.2

2- Download PCL 1.8 (instead of using system PCL 1.7)
  cd ~/src

  wget https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/archive/pcl-1.8.0.tar.gz

  tar -xvzf pcl-1.8.0.tar.gz

3. Configure PCL to compile with C++ 2011 support #probably unnecessary
We need to compile pcl with c++ 2011 support because we're going to be compiling rdbgslam with c++ 2011 support and if we don't, rgbdslam will segfault on startup.
the PCL 1.7 library that comes installed with ubuntu 16.04 is not compiled with c++ 2011 support.

  cd ~/src/pcl-pcl-1.8.0

  vi CMakeLists.txt

add the following to line #146 of CMakeLists.txt (right after endif()):

  SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")

save the file and exit (:wq)

4. Compile and install PCL
This will take forever - 2.5gig ram was insufficient for the task in virtualbox. 4.5gig works.

  mkdir build

  cd build

  cmake ../

To ensure that c++ 2011 support is being compiled into PCL, run:

make VERBOSE=1
and then copy some compiler output to a text file and search it to see if it contains "-stdc++11"
If you can't find -stdc++11 in the output, then you probably inserted it into the wrong place in the CMakeLists.txt
perhaps press ctrl-c and restart the build with just 'make' to clean up the output

  sudo make install

5- Download tar.gz for python pcl and extract it
https://github.com/strawlab/python-pcl/releases/tag/v0.3.0rc1

cd into the python-pcl directory 

  python setup.py build_ext -i
  
  python setup.py install
  
  ldconfig
  
6- Open your .bashrc file and add
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<the path you installed pcl to>

7- Test 
python
> import pcl
> p = pcl.PointCloud()
